PyRedirector

A URL redirector written in Python using Flask.

Requires: Python 2.7+ with Flask and ConfigParser installed.

Why?

I run a media server with a bunch of Docler containers to handle automation and services.
Since the containers all run on different ports, it is hard to keep track of all of them.
I decided to write a URL recirector to help simplify access, and so I can better learn Python.

This is my first time doing a real Python project, first time using flask, and first time putting something on GitHub.

Still a work in progress...

Things to add:

Allow Redirecting to remote servers
Create a web interface for configuring redirects
Create simnple logging to log when a redirect is accessed and by whom.
Create logic to detect and alert for invalid config, such as duplicate paths or malformed IPs or URLs.
Allow specifying the port in the config file
Make the documentation look pretty with Markdown

How to Install and Run:
