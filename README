PyRedirector

A URL redirector written in Python using Flask.

Why?

I run a media server with a bunch of Docler containers to handle automation and services. since the containers all run on different ports, it is hard to keep track of all of them. I decided to write a URL recirector to help simplify access.

this is my first time doing a real Python project, first time using flask, and first time putting something on GitHub.

Still a work in progress...
